	<h2>Whatever you need,</br>Flynn can help.</h2>
	<h3>Getting apps running in the cloud is way too hard.</h3>
	<p>Deployment. Ops. Databases. Containers. Configuration management. Service discovery. Forget about all of them.</p>
	<p>Flynn is all you need to know.</p>
	<p>Flynn is a simple, turnkey solution to cloud, containers, ops, whatever you want to call it. Flynn manages all the technology you need under the surface. So you get all the benefits with none of the work or complexity.</p>
	<p>Get back to writing your app and running your business.</p>
	<p>And Flynn gets better everyday. We track the infrastructure space closely and regularly integrate new components and features, so you get the best technology without having to figure out how everything fits together.</p>
	<p>And like all good things, it's completely free.</p>

	<h3>Growth is hard.</h3>

	<p>Users love your product and you're growing like crazy. Your engineering team is already stretched thin keeping up with growth.</p>
	<p>You're using more cloud instances, apps, containers, languages, frameworks, and databases.</p>
	<p>Your ops team (if you have one) is already under water trying to keep up.</p>	
	<p>Flynn helps you breeze through those challenges.</p>
	<p>Developers can deploy with a single command straight from git. Operators manage a single platform instead of doing custom work before each app can be deployed.</p>
	<p>Databases manage themselves. Service discovery, scheduling, containers, routing, and cluster management are all taken care of in the background.</p>

	<h3>Your world is changing too quickly.</h3>

	<p>New languages, frameworks, version control systems, databases, architectures, and other bleeding-edge technologies are taking over, fast.<p>
	<p>You need containers, microservices, polyglot everything, and cost savings yesterday.</p>
	<p>Developers need the best tools for the job in a changing world. Operators and IT teams need a platform they can manage instead of building everything from scratch, one piece at a time.</p>
	<p>Flynn has you covered. All the shiny new best practices in a single turnkey solution.</p>
	<p>It's free and open source so you can have tomorrow's technology today without any lock-in.</p>
	
	<h3>We can run it for you.</h3>
	<p>You can run Flynn yourself or our experienced team can install, run, and manage a Flynn cluster for you. We work with your developers to help you get the most out of Flynn and your apps. And since Flynn is 100% open source there's no lock-in.</p>
	<p>We can also support your ops, IT, or sysadmins team 24/7 if you prefer to handle things yourself but still want help on call.</p>
